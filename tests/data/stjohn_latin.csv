chapter,verse,english,latin
1,1,In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God: and the Word was God.,in principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum et Deus erat Verbum
1,2,The same was in the beginning with God.,hoc erat in principio apud Deum
1,3,All things were made by him: and without him was made nothing that was made.,omnia per ipsum facta sunt et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est
1,4,In him was life: and the life was the light of men.,in ipso vita erat et vita erat lux hominum
1,5,And the light shineth in darkness: and the darkness did not comprehend it.,et lux in tenebris lucet et tenebrae eam non conprehenderunt
1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.",fuit homo missus a Deo cui nomen erat Iohannes
1,7,"This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him.",hic venit in testimonium ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine ut omnes crederent per illum
1,8,"He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light.",non erat ille lux sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine
1,9,"That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.",erat lux vera quae inluminat omnem hominem venientem in mundum
1,10,He was in the world: and the world was made by him: and the world knew him not.,in mundo erat et mundus per ipsum factus est et mundus eum non cognovit
1,11,He came unto his own: and his own received him not.,in propria venit et sui eum non receperunt
1,12,"But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons of God, to them that believe in his name.",quotquot autem receperunt eum dedit eis potestatem filios Dei fieri his qui credunt in nomine eius
1,13,"Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.",qui non ex sanguinibus neque ex voluntate carnis neque ex voluntate viri sed ex Deo nati sunt
1,14,"And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.",et Verbum caro factum est et habitavit in nobis et vidimus gloriam eius gloriam quasi unigeniti a Patre plenum gratiae et veritatis
1,15,"John beareth witness of him and crieth out, saying: This was he of whom I spoke: He that shall come after me is preferred before me: because he was before me.",Iohannes testimonium perhibet de ipso et clamat dicens hic erat quem dixi vobis qui post me venturus est ante me factus est quia prior me erat
1,16,And of his fulness we all have received: and grace for grace.,et de plenitudine eius nos omnes accepimus et gratiam pro gratia
1,17,For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.,quia lex per Mosen data est gratia et veritas per Iesum Christum facta est
1,18,"No man hath seen God at any time: the only begotten Son who is in the Bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.",Deum nemo vidit umquam unigenitus Filius qui est in sinu Patris ipse enarravit
1,19,"And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who art thou?",et hoc est testimonium Iohannis quando miserunt Iudaei ab Hierosolymis sacerdotes et Levitas ad eum ut interrogarent eum tu quis es
1,20,And he confessed and did not deny: and he confessed: I am not the Christ.,et confessus est et non negavit et confessus est quia non sum ego Christus
1,21,And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.,et interrogaverunt eum quid ergo Helias es tu et dicit non sum propheta es tu et respondit non
1,22,"They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?",dixerunt ergo ei quis es ut responsum demus his qui miserunt nos quid dicis de te ipso
1,23,"He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaias.",ait ego vox clamantis in deserto dirigite viam Domini sicut dixit Esaias propheta
1,24,And they that were sent were of the Pharisees.,et qui missi fuerant erant ex Pharisaeis
1,25,"And they asked him and said to him: Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?",et interrogaverunt eum et dixerunt ei quid ergo baptizas si tu non es Christus neque Helias neque propheta
1,26,"John answered them, saying: I baptize with water: but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not.",respondit eis Iohannes dicens ego baptizo in aqua medius autem vestrum stetit quem vos non scitis
1,27,"The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.",ipse est qui post me venturus est qui ante me factus est cuius ego non sum dignus ut solvam eius corrigiam calciamenti
1,28,"These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.",haec in Bethania facta sunt trans Iordanen ubi erat Iohannes baptizans
1,29,"The next day, John saw Jesus coming to him; and he saith: Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who taketh away the sin of the world.",altera die videt Iohannes Iesum venientem ad se et ait ecce agnus Dei qui tollit peccatum mundi
1,30,"This is he of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me.",hic est de quo dixi post me venit vir qui ante me factus est quia prior me erat
1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.",et ego nesciebam eum sed ut manifestaretur Israhel propterea veni ego in aqua baptizans
1,32,"And John gave testimony, saying: I saw the Spirit coming down, as a dove from heaven; and he remained upon him.",et testimonium perhibuit Iohannes dicens quia vidi Spiritum descendentem quasi columbam de caelo et mansit super eum
1,33,"And I knew him not: but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.",et ego nesciebam eum sed qui misit me baptizare in aqua ille mihi dixit super quem videris Spiritum descendentem et manentem super eum hic est qui baptizat in Spiritu Sancto
1,34,And I saw: and I gave testimony that this is the Son of God.,et ego vidi et testimonium perhibui quia hic est Filius Dei
1,35,The next day again John stood and two of his disciples.,altera die iterum stabat Iohannes et ex discipulis eius duo
1,36,"And beholding Jesus walking, he saith: Behold the Lamb of God.",et respiciens Iesum ambulantem dicit ecce agnus Dei
1,37,And the two disciples heard him speak: and they followed Jesus.,et audierunt eum duo discipuli loquentem et secuti sunt Iesum
1,38,"And Jesus turning and seeing them following him, saith to them: What seek you? Who said to him: Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?",conversus autem Iesus et videns eos sequentes dicit eis quid quaeritis qui dixerunt ei rabbi quod dicitur interpretatum magister ubi habitas
1,39,He saith to them: Come and see. They came and saw where he abode: and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about the tenth hour.,dicit eis venite et videte venerunt et viderunt ubi maneret et apud eum manserunt die illo hora autem erat quasi decima
1,40,"And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard of John and followed him.",erat autem Andreas frater Simonis Petri unus ex duobus qui audierant ab Iohanne et secuti fuerant eum
1,41,"He findeth first his brother Simon and saith to him: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.",invenit hic primum fratrem suum Simonem et dicit ei invenimus Messiam quod est interpretatum Christus
1,42,"And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona. Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.",et adduxit eum ad Iesum intuitus autem eum Iesus dixit tu es Simon filius Iohanna tu vocaberis Cephas quod interpretatur Petrus
1,43,"On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee: and he findeth Philip, And Jesus saith to him: follow me.",in crastinum voluit exire in Galilaeam et invenit Philippum et dicit ei Iesus sequere me
1,44,"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.",erat autem Philippus a Bethsaida civitate Andreae et Petri
1,45,"Philip findeth Nathanael and saith to him: We have found him of whom Moses, in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.",invenit Philippus Nathanahel et dicit ei quem scripsit Moses in lege et prophetae invenimus Iesum filium Ioseph a Nazareth
1,46,And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.,et dixit ei Nathanahel a Nazareth potest aliquid boni esse dicit ei Philippus veni et vide
1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and he saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.",vidit Iesus Nathanahel venientem ad se et dicit de eo ecce vere Israhelita in quo dolus non est
1,48,"Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him:Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.",dicit ei Nathanahel unde me nosti respondit Iesus et dixit ei priusquam te Philippus vocaret cum esses sub ficu vidi te
1,49,Nathanael answered him and said: Rabbi: Thou art the Son of God. Thou art the King of Israel.,respondit ei Nathanahel et ait rabbi tu es Filius Dei tu es rex Israhel
1,50,"Jesus answered and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.",respondit Iesus et dixit ei quia dixi tibi vidi te sub ficu credis maius his videbis
1,51,"And he saith to him: Amen, amen, I say to you, you shall see the heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.",et dicit ei amen amen dico vobis videbitis caelum apertum et angelos Dei ascendentes et descendentes supra Filium hominis
2,1,"And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.",et die tertio nuptiae factae sunt in Cana Galilaeae et erat mater Iesu ibi
2,2,"And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage.",vocatus est autem ibi et Iesus et discipuli eius ad nuptias
2,3,"And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine.",et deficiente vino dicit mater Iesu ad eum vinum non habent
2,4,"And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to thee? My hour is not yet come.",et dicit ei Iesus quid mihi et tibi est mulier nondum venit hora mea
2,5,"His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.",dicit mater eius ministris quodcumque dixerit vobis facite
2,6,"Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece.",erant autem ibi lapideae hydriae sex positae secundum purificationem Iudaeorum capientes singulae metretas binas vel ternas
2,7,Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.,dicit eis Iesus implete hydrias aquaet impleverunt eas usque ad summum
2,8,And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.,et dicit eis Iesus haurite nunc et ferte architriclino et tulerunt
2,9,"And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had drawn the water: the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,",ut autem gustavit architriclinus aquam vinum factam et non sciebat unde esset ministri autem sciebant qui haurierant aquam vocat sponsum architriclinus
2,10,"And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the good wine until now.",et dicit ei omnis homo primum bonum vinum ponit et cum inebriati fuerint tunc id quod deterius est tu servasti bonum vinum usque adhuc
2,11,This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.,hoc fecit initium signorum Iesus in Cana Galilaeae et manifestavit gloriam suam et crediderunt in eum discipuli eius
2,12,"After this, he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.",post hoc descendit Capharnaum ipse et mater eius et fratres eius et discipuli eius et ibi manserunt non multis diebus
2,13,And the pasch of the Jews was at hand: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.,et prope erat pascha Iudaeorum et ascendit Hierosolyma Iesus
2,14,"And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.",et invenit in templo vendentes boves et oves et columbas et nummularios sedentes
2,15,"And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the oxen: and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.",et cum fecisset quasi flagellum de funiculis omnes eiecit de templo oves quoque et boves et nummulariorum effudit aes et mensas subvertit
2,16,"And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic.",et his qui columbas vendebant dixit auferte ista hinc nolite facere domum Patris mei domum negotiationis
2,17,"And his disciples remembered, that it was written: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.",recordati vero sunt discipuli eius quia scriptum est zelus domus tuae comedit me
2,18,"The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?",responderunt ergo Iudaei et dixerunt ei quod signum ostendis nobis quia haec facis
2,19,Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple; and in three days I will raise it up.,respondit Iesus et dixit eis solvite templum hoc et in tribus diebus excitabo illud
2,20,The Jews then said: Six and forty years was this temple in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?,dixerunt ergo Iudaei quadraginta et sex annis aedificatum est templum hoc et tu tribus diebus excitabis illud
2,21,But he spoke of the temple of his body.,ille autem dicebat de templo corporis sui
2,22,"When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this: and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had said.",cum ergo resurrexisset a mortuis recordati sunt discipuli eius quia hoc dicebat et crediderunt scripturae et sermoni quem dixit Iesus
2,23,"Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he did.",cum autem esset Hierosolymis in pascha in die festo multi crediderunt in nomine eius videntes signa eius quae faciebat
2,24,"But Jesus did not trust himself unto them: for that he knew all men,",ipse autem Iesus non credebat semet ipsum eis eo quod ipse nosset omnes
2,25,And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man: for he knew what was in man.,et quia opus ei non erat ut quis testimonium perhiberet de homine ipse enim sciebat quid esset in homine
3,1,"And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",erat autem homo ex Pharisaeis Nicodemus nomine princeps Iudaeorum
3,2,"This man came to Jesus by night and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.",hic venit ad eum nocte et dixit ei rabbi scimus quia a Deo venisti magister nemo enim potest haec signa facere quae tu facis nisi fuerit Deus cum eo
3,3,"Jesus answered and said to him: Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.",respondit Iesus et dixit ei amen amen dico tibi nisi quis natus fuerit denuo non potest videre regnum Dei
3,4,Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born again?,dicit ad eum Nicodemus quomodo potest homo nasci cum senex sit numquid potest in ventrem matris suae iterato introire et nasci
3,5,"Jesus answered: Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",respondit Iesus amen amen dico tibi nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et Spiritu non potest introire in regnum Dei
3,6,That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.,quod natum est ex carne caro est et quod natum est ex Spiritu spiritus est
3,7,Wonder not that I said to thee: You must be born again.,non mireris quia dixi tibi oportet vos nasci denuo
3,8,The Spirit breatheth where he will and thou hearest his voice: but thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.,Spiritus ubi vult spirat et vocem eius audis sed non scis unde veniat et quo vadat sic est omnis qui natus est ex Spiritu
3,9,Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be done?,respondit Nicodemus et dixit ei quomodo possunt haec fieri
3,10,"Jesus answered and said to him: Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?",respondit Iesus et dixit ei tu es magister Israhel et haec ignoras
3,11,"Amen, amen, I say to thee that we speak what we know and we testify what we have seen: and you receive not our testimony.",amen amen dico tibi quia quod scimus loquimur et quod vidimus testamur et testimonium nostrum non accipitis
3,12,"If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not: how will you believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly things?",si terrena dixi vobis et non creditis quomodo si dixero vobis caelestia credetis
3,13,"And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.",et nemo ascendit in caelum nisi qui descendit de caelo Filius hominis qui est in caelo
3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:",et sicut Moses exaltavit serpentem in deserto ita exaltari oportet Filium hominis
3,15,"That whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting.",ut omnis qui credit in ipso non pereat sed habeat vitam aeternam
3,16,"For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son: that whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting.",sic enim dilexit Deus mundum ut Filium suum unigenitum daret ut omnis qui credit in eum non pereat sed habeat vitam aeternam
3,17,"For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world: but that the world may be saved by him.",non enim misit Deus Filium suum in mundum ut iudicet mundum sed ut salvetur mundus per ipsum
3,18,He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.,qui credit in eum non iudicatur qui autem non credit iam iudicatus est quia non credidit in nomine unigeniti Filii Dei
3,19,And this is the judgment: Because the light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.,hoc est autem iudicium quia lux venit in mundum et dilexerunt homines magis tenebras quam lucem erant enim eorum mala opera
3,20,"For every one that doth evil hateth the light and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.",omnis enim qui mala agit odit lucem et non venit ad lucem ut non arguantur opera eius
3,21,"But he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest: because they are done in God.",qui autem facit veritatem venit ad lucem ut manifestentur eius opera quia in Deo sunt facta
3,22,"After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea: and there he abode with them and baptized.",post haec venit Iesus et discipuli eius in iudaeam terram et illic demorabatur cum eis et baptizabat
3,23,And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim: because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.,erat autem et Iohannes baptizans in Aenon iuxta Salim quia aquae multae erant illic et adveniebant et baptizabantur
3,24,For John was not yet cast into prison.,nondum enim missus fuerat in carcerem Iohannes
3,25,"And there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews, concerning purification.",facta est ergo quaestio ex discipulis Iohannis cum Iudaeis de purificatione
3,26,"And they came to John and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony: behold, he baptizeth and all men come to him.",et venerunt ad Iohannem et dixerunt ei rabbi qui erat tecum trans Iordanen cui tu testimonium perhibuisti ecce hic baptizat et omnes veniunt ad eum
3,27,"John answered and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.",respondit Iohannes et dixit non potest homo accipere quicquam nisi fuerit ei datum de caelo
3,28,"You yourselves do bear me witness that I said that I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.",ipsi vos mihi testimonium perhibetis quod dixerim ego non sum Christus sed quia missus sum ante illum
3,29,"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.",qui habet sponsam sponsus est amicus autem sponsi qui stat et audit eum gaudio gaudet propter vocem sponsi hoc ergo gaudium meum impletum est
3,30,He must increase: but I must decrease.,illum oportet crescere me autem minui
3,31,"He that cometh from above is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven is above all.",qui desursum venit supra omnes est qui est de terra de terra est et de terra loquitur qui de caelo venit supra omnes est
3,32,"And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.",et quod vidit et audivit hoc testatur et testimonium eius nemo accipit
3,33,He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.,qui accipit eius testimonium signavit quia Deus verax est
3,34,For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.,quem enim misit Deus verba Dei loquitur non enim ad mensuram dat Deus Spiritum
3,35,The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.,Pater diligit Filium et omnia dedit in manu eius
3,36,He that believeth in the Son hath life everlasting: but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.,qui credit in Filium habet vitam aeternam qui autem incredulus est Filio non videbit vitam sed ira Dei manet super eum
4,1,When Jesus therefore understood the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples and baptizeth more than John,ut ergo cognovit Iesus quia audierunt Pharisaei quia Iesus plures discipulos facit et baptizat quam Iohannes
4,2,"(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples),",quamquam Iesus non baptizaret sed discipuli eius
4,3,He left Judea and went again into Galilee.,reliquit Iudaeam et abiit iterum in Galilaeam
4,4,And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.,oportebat autem eum transire per Samariam
4,5,"He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",venit ergo in civitatem Samariae quae dicitur Sychar iuxta praedium quod dedit Iacob Ioseph filio suo
4,6,"Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.",erat autem ibi fons Iacob Iesus ergo fatigatus ex itinere sedebat sic super fontem hora erat quasi sexta
4,7,"There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.",venit mulier de Samaria haurire aquam dicit ei Iesus da mihi bibere
4,8,For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.,discipuli enim eius abierant in civitatem ut cibos emerent
4,9,"Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew; ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.",dicit ergo ei mulier illa samaritana quomodo tu Iudaeus cum sis bibere a me poscis quae sum mulier samaritana non enim coutuntur Iudaei Samaritanis
4,10,"Jesus answered and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God and who he is that saith to thee: Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.",respondit Iesus et dixit ei si scires donum Dei et quis est qui dicit tibi da mihi bibere tu forsitan petisses ab eo et dedisset tibi aquam vivam
4,11,"The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep. From whence then hast thou living water?",dicit ei mulier Domine neque in quo haurias habes et puteus altus est unde ergo habes aquam vivam
4,12,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank thereof, himself and his children and his cattle?",numquid tu maior es patre nostro Iacob qui dedit nobis puteum et ipse ex eo bibit et filii eius et pecora eius
4,13,Jesus answered and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not thirst for ever.,respondit Iesus et dixit ei omnis qui bibit ex aqua hac sitiet iterum qui autem biberit ex aqua quam ego dabo ei non sitiet in aeternum
4,14,"But the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.",sed aqua quam dabo ei fiet in eo fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam
4,15,"The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.",dicit ad eum mulier Domine da mihi hanc aquam ut non sitiam neque veniam huc haurire
4,16,"Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.",dicit ei Iesus vade voca virum tuum et veni huc
4,17,The woman answered and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well: I have no husband.,respondit mulier et dixit non habeo virum dicit ei Iesus bene dixisti quia non habeo virum
4,18,"For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. This, thou hast said truly.",quinque enim viros habuisti et nunc quem habes non est tuus vir hoc vere dixisti
4,19,"The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.",dicit ei mulier Domine video quia propheta es tu
4,20,Our fathers adored on this mountain: and you say that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.,patres nostri in monte hoc adoraverunt et vos dicitis quia Hierosolymis est locus ubi adorare oportet
4,21,"Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father.",dicit ei Iesus mulier crede mihi quia veniet hora quando neque in monte hoc neque in Hierosolymis adorabitis Patrem
4,22,You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know. For salvation is of the Jews.,vos adoratis quod nescitis nos adoramus quod scimus quia salus ex Iudaeis est
4,23,"But the hour cometh and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.",sed venit hora et nunc est quando veri adoratores adorabunt Patrem in spiritu et veritate nam et Pater tales quaerit qui adorent eum
4,24,God is a spirit: and they that adore him must adore him in spirit and in truth.,spiritus est Deus et eos qui adorant eum in spiritu et veritate oportet adorare
4,25,"The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ): therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.",dicit ei mulier scio quia Messias venit qui dicitur Christus cum ergo venerit ille nobis adnuntiabit omnia
4,26,"Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.",dicit ei Iesus ego sum qui loquor tecum
4,27,And immediately his disciples came. And they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? Or: Why talkest thou with her?,et continuo venerunt discipuli eius et mirabantur quia cum muliere loquebatur nemo tamen dixit quid quaeris aut quid loqueris cum ea
4,28,The woman therefore left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men there:,reliquit ergo hydriam suam mulier et abiit in civitatem et dicit illis hominibus
4,29,"Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?",venite videte hominem qui dixit mihi omnia quaecumque feci numquid ipse est Christus
4,30,They went therefore out of the city and came unto him.,exierunt de civitate et veniebant ad eum
